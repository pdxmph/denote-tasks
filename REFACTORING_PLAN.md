# Refactoring Plan: denote-tasks Focus on Task Management

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to refactor denote-tasks from a dual notes/tasks system to a focused task management tool. The project will maintain Denote format compatibility for backward compatibility and consistent file identification, but will remove all general notes functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have Now
1. **Dual Mode System**: Both notes and tasks functionality
2. **Complex CLI**: Commands for both notes and tasks
3. **Complex TUI**: View modes for notes and tasks
4. **Mixed Concerns**: Code that handles both notes and tasks interchangeably

### What We Want
1. **Task-Only System**: Focus exclusively on task management
2. **Simplified CLI**: Only task and project commands
3. **Simplified TUI**: Only task and project views
4. **Clear Purpose**: A dedicated task management tool using Denote format

## Architecture Changes

│   └── tui/                 # TUI implementation (task-only)
└── docs/                    # Specifications
```

### Components to Remove
1. **Notes-specific views** in TUI
2. **Notes commands** in CLI
3. **ViewMode switching** between notes and tasks
4. **General file browsing** capabilities

### Components to Keep
1. **Denote package** - For file naming and ID generation
2. **Task metadata handling** - Core functionality
3. **Project management** - Essential for task organization
4. **Filter system** - Adapted for tasks only
5. **Both CLI and TUI** - But simplified

## Detailed Refactoring Steps

### Phase 1: Define New Data Model

#### Task-Only File Types
- **Task Files**: `*__task*.md` with task metadata
- **Project Files**: `*__project*.md` with project metadata
- **No General Notes**: Remove support for files without task/project tags

#### Simplified View Model
```go
// Remove ViewMode enum, always in "task mode"
type Model struct {
    // Core data
    tasks         []*denote.Task
    projects      []*denote.Project
    filtered      []*denote.Task
    
    // UI state
    cursor        int
    mode          UIMode  // Normal, Search, Create, etc.
    
    // Filters (task-specific)
    areaFilter    string
    priorityFilter string
    statusFilter  string
    projectFilter string
    
    // Remove notes-specific fields
}
```

### Phase 2: CLI Simplification

#### Commands to Keep (Modified)
```bash
# Task commands
denote-tasks task new "Task title" [options]
denote-tasks task list [filters]
denote-tasks task update <id> [options]
denote-tasks task done <id>
denote-tasks task delete <id>
denote-tasks task log <id> "message"

# Project commands  
denote-tasks project new "Project title" [options]
denote-tasks project list [filters]
denote-tasks project tasks <project-id>
denote-tasks project update <id> [options]

# Global options
denote-tasks --tui  # Launch TUI in task mode
```

#### Commands to Remove
- Any generic "note" commands
- File browsing commands
- Mode switching options

### Phase 3: TUI Simplification

#### Views to Keep (Modified)
1. **Task List View** - Main view showing tasks
2. **Project List View** - Toggled with 'p' key
3. **Task Detail View** - For viewing/editing tasks
4. **Project Detail View** - Shows project and its tasks
5. **Create Forms** - For new tasks/projects

#### Views to Remove
1. **Notes browsing view**
2. **Mode switching UI**
3. **Generic file operations**

#### Simplified Key Bindings
```
Task List:
  j/k     - Navigate
  Enter   - View task details
  c       - Create new task
  x       - Delete task
  d       - Mark done
  p       - Toggle project view
  /       - Search tasks
  f       - Filter menu
  S       - Sort menu
  q       - Quit

Project List:
  j/k     - Navigate  
  Enter   - View project tasks
  c       - Create new project
  x       - Delete project
  t       - Back to task list
  /       - Search projects
  q       - Quit
```

### Phase 4: Code Changes

#### Files to Modify Heavily

1. **internal/tui/model.go**
   - Remove ViewMode enum and switching logic
   - Remove notes-specific fields
   - Simplify to task-only model

2. **internal/tui/views.go**
   - Remove renderFileLine for generic files
   - Keep only renderTaskLine and renderProjectLine
   - Simplify header to show "Denote Tasks" only

3. **internal/cli/cli.go**
   - Remove notes commands
   - Simplify command structure
   - Update help text

4. **internal/tui/keys.go**
   - Remove 't' key for mode switching
   - Remove notes-specific hotkeys
   - Simplify key handling

#### Files to Keep Mostly Unchanged

1. **internal/denote/** - Core Denote functionality still needed
2. **internal/task/** - Core task logic
3. **internal/config/** - Configuration system
4. **internal/core/filter.go** - Filtering logic (adapt for tasks)

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates

1. **Update PROJECT_CHARTER.md**
   - Remove references to notes functionality
   - Clarify task-only focus
   - Update examples

2. **Update README.md**
   - Clear description as task management tool
   - Remove notes examples
   - Focus on task workflows

3. **Update CLI_REFERENCE.md**
   - Remove notes commands
   - Update examples
   - Clarify task focus

## Migration Considerations

### For Existing Users
1. **Data Compatibility**: Task files remain unchanged
2. **Command Changes**: Document removed commands
3. **Workflow Changes**: Provide migration guide

### Backward Compatibility
1. **File Format**: Keep Denote format for all files
2. **Metadata**: Maintain same YAML structure
3. **IDs**: Continue using Denote IDs for references

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
1. Remove notes-specific tests
2. Enhance task operation tests
3. Add project management tests

### Integration Tests
1. CLI task workflows
2. TUI task operations
3. Project-task associations

### Manual Testing
1. Create tasks via CLI and TUI
2. Manage projects and associations
3. Filter and sort operations
4. Data integrity checks

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Clarity of Purpose**: Clear focus on task management
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler codebase to maintain
3. **Better UX**: No mode confusion, clearer workflows
4. **Easier Onboarding**: Single purpose tool
5. **Maintainability**: Less code, fewer edge cases

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: User Confusion
**Mitigation**: Clear documentation about the change, migration guide

### Risk: Feature Requests for Notes
**Mitigation**: Clear project charter, recommend separate tools

### Risk: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation**: Maintain file format compatibility, careful testing

3. **Clearer UX**: No mode switching or confusion
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Denote format preserved
5. **Better Performance**: Faster operations due to focus

## Next Steps

2. Create feature branch for refactoring
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Test thoroughly at each phase
5. Update documentation continuously
6. Plan migration communication
