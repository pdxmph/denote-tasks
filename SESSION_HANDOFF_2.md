# Session Handoff - denote-tasks TUI Implementation

## Session Summary (2025-01-13)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Task Mode Implementation (Issue #4) ✅ TESTED**
   - Mode toggle with 't' key between Notes/Tasks modes
   - File filtering based on mode (tasks show only __task/__project files)
   - Task-specific hotkeys in task mode
   - Visual improvements: ">" selection indicator, orange highlighting

2. **Task Metadata Features ✅ TESTED**
   - Loading and parsing task/project metadata from frontmatter
   - Rich display in task list with colors:
     - Status symbols: ○ (open), ● (done), ◐ (paused)
     - Priority colors: p1 (red), p2 (orange), p3 (gray)
     - Overdue tasks in bold red
     - Projects in purple with ▶ indicator
   - Priority updates with 1/2/3 keys (saves to disk)

3. **Interactive Task View (ENTER key) ✅ IMPLEMENTED**
   - Structured view of all task/project metadata
   - Hotkey editing for fields:
     - (p)riority - enter 1/2/3
     - (s)tatus - open/done/paused/etc
     - (d)ue date - YYYY-MM-DD
     - (a)rea - work/personal/etc
     - es(t)imate - Fibonacci numbers
     - ta(g)s - space-separated (NEW)
   - 'e' key opens file in external editor
   - Visual feedback during editing

### Key Technical Details

- **No type field required** - Tasks/projects identified by __task/__project filename tags
- **Frontmatter parsing** - Falls back to checking task_id/project_id
- **Visual consistency** - Leading space with ">" for selection, orange highlighting
- **In-memory caching** - taskMetadata and projectMetadata maps for performance

### Current File Structure

```
internal/tui/
├── model.go          # Core model with task/project metadata
├── keys.go           # Main key handling
├── task_view_keys.go # Task view mode key handling (NEW)
├── views.go          # List rendering with colors
├── task_view.go      # Task detail view rendering (NEW)
└── tui.go           # Entry point
```

### What's Left to Implement

1. **Sticky Area Filtering** (Priority: Low)
   - Add area filter state
   - Key to filter by area in task mode
   - CLI task creation inherits area filter

2. **Task-Specific Sorting**
   - Sort by priority
   - Sort by due date
   - Sort by estimate

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Validation for dates, priorities
   - User feedback for invalid input

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of metadata
   - Pagination for large lists

### Testing Notes

- All core features tested and working
- Visual selection is now consistent with ">" indicator
- Task metadata persists correctly to files
- External editor integration works with configured $EDITOR

### Next Session Starting Points

1. **Quick Win**: Implement area filtering
   - Add `areaFilter string` to Model
   - Add 'f' key to prompt for area filter
   - Update applyFilters() to respect area
   - Pass area to CLI task creation

2. **Medium Task**: Add task-specific sorting
   - Extend sortBy to include "priority", "due", "estimate"
   - Implement comparators for task metadata
   - Update sort key cycling

3. **Polish**: Add input validation
   - Date format validation
   - Priority value validation
   - Estimate Fibonacci validation

### Important Context

- NEVER mark features complete without human testing
- Type field is NOT required (determined by filename tags)
- Maintain visual consistency with ">" selection indicator
- All metadata changes save immediately to disk

Good luck with the next session!
