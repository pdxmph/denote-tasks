# Session Handoff - denote-tasks TUI Implementation

## Session Summary (2025-01-13)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Area Filtering (✅ TESTED)**
   - Added 'f' key to filter by area in task mode
   - Filter state shown in status line
   - Task creation inherits area filter
   - Case-insensitive filtering

2. **Enhanced Sorting (✅ TESTED)**
   - Implemented sort mode with 's' key
   - Direct hotkeys: d=due, p=priority, e=estimate, t=title, c=created, r=reverse
   - Task-specific sorting (priority, due date, estimate)
   - Visual sort menu showing current sort and options

3. **Performance Optimizations (✅ TESTED)**
   - Fixed slow performance after task creation
   - Lazy loading of task/project metadata
   - Metadata only loaded for visible files
   - Preserved metadata cache between scans

4. **Bug Fixes (✅ TESTED)**
   - Fixed TUI hotkeys interfering with external editor (using tea.ExecProcess)
   - Fixed metadata not loading on initial view
   - Fixed duplicate loadVisibleMetadata calls

5. **Task View Improvements (✅ TESTED)**
   - Added body content display below metadata
   - Horizontal separator between metadata and body
   - Text wrapping at 80 characters
   - Shows "(no notes)" when empty

6. **Natural Language Due Dates (✅ TESTED)**
   - Relative: 1d, 5d, 1w, 1m, 1y
   - Named: today, tomorrow, friday, sun
   - Month/day: jan 15, 15 jan
   - Clear error messages with format suggestions

### Current Architecture

```
internal/tui/
├── model.go              # Core model with lazy loading
├── keys.go               # Key handling with sort mode
├── task_view_keys.go     # Task view editing
├── views.go              # List and header rendering
├── task_view.go          # Task detail view with body
└── tui.go               # Entry point

internal/denote/
├── date_parser.go        # NEW: Natural language date parsing
└── scanner.go           # Enhanced with SortTaskFiles
```

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Lazy Loading Pattern**
   - Metadata loaded in loadVisibleMetadata()
   - Called after navigation, filtering, mode changes
   - Only parses files in visible viewport

2. **Sort Mode**
   - ModeSort added to Mode enum
   - handleSortKeys() processes sort selection
   - Different options for tasks vs notes

3. **Area Filtering**
   - Stored in Model.areaFilter
   - Applied in applyFilters()
   - Inherited by new tasks created with 'c'

4. **Editor Integration**
   - Uses tea.ExecProcess for proper TUI suspension
   - No more hotkey interference

### What's Left to Implement

1. **Input Validation**
   - Priority validation (only p1/p2/p3)
   - Estimate validation (Fibonacci numbers)
   - Status validation

2. **Quick Task Creation**
   - 'a' key for minimal task creation
   - Just title, inherits area filter

3. **Project Creation**
   - 'C' key to create projects
   - Similar flow to task creation

4. **Logging Feature**
   - 'l' key to add log entries
   - Appends to body with timestamp

5. **Pagination**
   - For directories with hundreds of files
   - Implement page up/down

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Area filtering works and persists
- [x] Sort mode with all options
- [x] Task creation inherits area
- [x] External editor doesn't get hotkey interference
- [x] Task view shows body content
- [x] Natural language dates parse correctly
- [x] Performance is good with many files

### Known Issues

None currently - all major issues resolved!

### Next Session Recommendations

1. **Priority**: Input validation to prevent data corruption
2. **Nice to have**: Quick task creation ('a' key)
3. **Nice to have**: Logging feature for task notes
4. **Low priority**: Pagination for huge directories

Good luck with the next session!
